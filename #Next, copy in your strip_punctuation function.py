#Next, copy in your strip_punctuation function and define a function called get_pos which takes one parameter, a string which represents one or more sentences, and calculates how many words in the string are considered positive words. Use the list, positive_words to determine what words will count as positive. The function should return a positive integer - how many occurrences there are of positive words in the text. Note that all of the words in positive_words are lower cased, so youâ€™ll need to convert all the words in the input string to lower case as well.
